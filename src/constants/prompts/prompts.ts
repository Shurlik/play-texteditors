  "buying behavior": `Buying Behavior based on Henry Assael 
			1. Complex Buying Behavior. Consumers exhibit high involvement and perceive significant differences among choices, typically seen in expensive and infrequent purchases like cars or real estate.
			2. Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior.	This occurs when a consumer feels post-purchase doubt after choosing between similar alternatives, often in high-cost and infrequent purchases.
			3. Habitual Buying Behavior. Low involvement and little perceived difference among products characterize this behavior, common in routine, everyday items like groceries.
			4. Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior. Here, the involvement is low but the perception of product differences is high, leading consumers to switch brands often for the sake of variety, such as with snacks or fashion.
